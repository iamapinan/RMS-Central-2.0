			<h1>The HDMI Advantage</h1><p>HDMI technology is the global standard for connecting high-definition equipment.

</p><h1>One Cable Does It All</h1><p><img src="http://www.hdmi.org/images/consumers/Right_Cable.jpg" alt="" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; border-width: 0px; padding-right: 20px; border-spacing: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; float: left;">HDMI technology transmits crystal-clear digital video, multi-channel surround audio, and advanced control data through a single cable. One HDMI cable can replace as many as eleven older cables, making your entertainment system easier to connect and easier to upgrade. You won’t find that level of elegant simplicity in any other connection.</p><h1>Pure Digital Performance</h1><p>Unlike older cables, an HDMI connection transmits uncompressed audio-video data in 100 percent digital form. That adds up to world-class viewing experience, with pixel-for-pixel video accuracy and audiophile-quality sound.</p><p><b>1080p and beyond</b> - HDMI is built to accommodate extremely high-resolution video, with bandwidth to spare for the next generation of HD equipment.</p><p><b>System intelligence</b> - HDMI-connected components have the ability to query each other’s capabilities and automatically adjust themselves for optimal viewing. A TV and a DVD player, for example, can auto-negotiate settings like resolution and aspect ratio.</p><center><img src="http://www.hdmi.org/images/consumers/hdmi_advantage_new.jpg" alt="" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; border-width: 0px; border-spacing: 0px; border-collapse: collapse;"></center><p><b>Advanced features</b> - The HDMI Specification includes many advanced functions that are helping to change the way we experience home theater – now and in the future.
